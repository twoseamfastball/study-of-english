    It’s easier to learn English reading than you think! Here, we will discuss how you can improve using staircases and scaffolding.<br>

    When a house is built, it doesn’t all get done at the same time. Workers have to build some temporary structures to help keep the house standing up and to help them work on the higher parts. These structures are called scaffolding.

    <br><br>Scaffolding is also a method of learning. The idea is that, to learn a skill well, you need to learn smaller parts that will help you “build” your knowledge and skills.

    <br><br>This is true for reading comprehension too! To really understand what you read, you might need to work on other skills first. You might need to practice reading quickly (or slowly). You might need to stop choosing very difficult books, and start choosing the right books for your skill level. Start easier, start smaller and slower, and then gradually increase the difficulty.

    <br><br>Remember this when you’re working to improve your reading comprehension—and any other English language skill!

    <br><br>The steps below will show you exactly how to improve reading skills the right way. Use these tips and you’ll be understanding a lot more of what you read.

      <p><h3>1. Always Make Special Time to Read</h3></p>
      Reading for fun can be done anywhere. You could take a fun book out on a bus, in bed or at the office, and you can enjoy it.

      <br><br>However, if you’re reading to improve your comprehension, you need to focus and study.

      <br><br>      This means you need to make a special time for this reading. Making time for your reading will let you focus well without risk of being interrupted. This time should be quiet, and you should avoid being distracted.

            <br><br>You should try to spend at least 30 minutes every day on focused reading. That’s how to improve your reading skills seriously and successfully. The more you read, the more you’ll improve.



      <p><h3>2. Read the Right Books</h3></p>

      If you dislike science fiction, you might not want to read book about a man stuck on Mars. When you’re choosing books (and other texts) to read, keep two things in mind:

            <br><br>  1. What you’re interested in

            <br><br>      2. Your reading level

            <br><br>      Whenever you can, you should read things that you enjoy. You should also choose books that are at an English level just above the one you’re most comfortable with. You want to challenge yourself just enough to learn new things, but not enough to get frustrated with your reading.



      <p><h3>3. Ask Yourself Questions While Reading and After Reading</h3></p>
            <br><br>Learning how to read English books is about more than just reading the words!

            <br><br>There are a few things you can do before, during and after reading to help you better understand the text.

            <br><br>Before you read, browse the text. That means you should look over the text quickly without actually reading every word.

            <br><br>Take some time after you read too, to browse again and summarize what you remember. Try to quickly say or write a few sentences that describe what the text was about.

            <br><br>Thinking about what you read will show you how much of it you really understood, and help you figure out if you still have questions

      <p><h3>4. Improve Fluency First</h3></p>
      Reading. Is. Fun.

            <br><br>Do you notice how you stopped every time you saw the period?

            <br><br>Now imagine reading an entire article or even book like this, stopping after every word. It would be difficult to understand, wouldn’t it?

            <br><br>It’s hard to form an understanding of what you’re reading when you read word-by-word instead of in full sentences. That’s why, to improve your understanding, it’s important to improve your fluency first.

            <br><br>Fluency is how smoothly you can read. When you read in your head, you should have a certain rhythm to the words. The words should flow together naturally, like when somebody is talking. That’s how to read English books like a native speaker would.

            <br><br>Improving fluency can be as simple as choosing slightly easier texts to read, or it might take some time and practice. If you take some time to improve how fluently you read, though, it will help you in the future. You’ll improve your reading and even your speaking. It will also make reading feel more fun and natural.

      <p><h3>5. Once You’ve Learned to Speed Up, Slow Down!</h3></p>

          <br><br>After you learn English reading more fluently, you can stop worrying about your speed and start thinking about the text and its meaning.

          <br><br>That’s right, now that you can read fast, it’s time to read slowly. Take time to really get into the text you’re reading, instead of speeding through it.


      <p><h3>6. Ask Lots of Questions</h3></p>

          <br><br>Speaking of questions—ask them. Ask a lot of them! The more you question what you read, the deeper you get into the meaning.

          <br><br>Asking questions is also a good way to make sure you understand what you’re reading. Asking questions like “what’s happening now?” or “who’s speaking here?” can help keep you focused. Asking questions like “why did he do that?” or “what is she thinking?” can help you think deeper into the story.



      <p><h3>7. Read It Again</h3></p>

          <br><br>The poet Ezra Pound says that with books, “no reader ever read anything the first time he saw it.”

          <br><br>Sometimes reading a text just once isn’t enough to understand it. This is true if you’re reading something difficult, or even if you’re not—reading something more than once can help you understand it much better.

          <br><br>Re-reading is great for those times when you read the words but can’t get them to make sense. It’s also great for finding things you might have missed the first time. If there are any new words in the text, you’ll see them again every time your read again, helping you remember them.

          <br><br>In short, reading things again is great!




      <p><h3>8. Read Many Kinds of Texts</h3></p>

          <br><br>Today we don’t just read books and newspapers. We read blogs, emails, Tweets and texts. The more you read anything in English, the better you’ll get at the language.

          <br><br>Don’t just read books and news. Read anything and everything! Find a magazine that you enjoy, follow some interesting people or websites on Facebook, or visit a blog you like reading.

          <br><br>Magazine Line is a good place to go to find digital or print magazines on just about any subject. They give you lower prices on magazine subscriptions, and you may be able to save even more if you’re a student (check the “Student and Educator Rates” section for details).
